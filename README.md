## Presentation 📚:
What is Nuclear Security?
Nuclear Security is a program that guarantees security on the web, in fact one of its first functions is to generate random passwords with +42,000 different combinations. Furthermore, the function has recently been implemented: Ping,
with the latter, you can ping the github servers
Obviously in the future the developers will proceed with the implementation of other small operations that Nuclear Security can carry out.
